## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
gradlew clean build
```

Node.js is automatically downloaded using the `gradle-node-plugin` and the final JS/CSS files are integrated into the jar.

Start your application with the following command - here with the profile `production`:

```
java -Dspring.profiles.active=production -jar ./build/libs/movie-book-rating-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

If required, a Docker image can be created with the Spring Boot plugin. Add `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=production` as environment variable when running the container.

```
gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=com.mxdot/movie-book-rating
```
